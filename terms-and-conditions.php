        <h2>3. Shipping and Delivery</h2>
        <p>At King Deo and Queen Grace, we prioritize providing a seamless and reliable delivery experience for our customers. By default, we handle the shipment and delivery of orders through our own dedicated team of riders. This allows us to maintain control over the entire delivery process and ensure that our high standards of service are met.</p>
        <p>However, we understand that some customers may have specific preferences or requirements when it comes to delivery. In such cases, we offer the flexibility for customers to choose third-party delivery services like Grab, Lalamove, or other trusted providers. This way, we can accommodate their requests and ensure that their orders are delivered in a manner that best suits their needs.</p>
        <p>When a customer opts for third-party delivery services, we coordinate with the chosen provider to arrange for the pickup and delivery of the order. We provide all the necessary details and packaging instructions to ensure a smooth handover and secure transportation. Our team closely monitors the progress of the delivery and maintains communication with the customer to address any concerns or provide updates on the shipment status.</p>

        <h2>4. Returns and Refunds</h2>
        <p>At King Deo and Queen Grace, we have a unique returns and refunds policy. We do not offer returns or refunds for purchased products. However, we understand that there may be instances where a problem arises with the unit of the product that a customer has purchased.</p>
        <p>In such cases, we strive to provide a solution that guarantees customer satisfaction. Instead of offering a return and refund, we offer a replacement with a more costly unit type of the product. Our aim is to offer an upgrade to the customer, providing them with a higher-value product as a resolution.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we provide the customer with a voucher to express our appreciation for their understanding and to maintain a positive customer experience. This voucher can be used towards purchases of the more costly unit of the product.</p>
        <p>By offering a replacement with a more costly unit and providing a voucher, we intend to address any issues that may arise while ensuring that our customers receive value and satisfaction from their shopping experience with us.</p>
        <p>Please note that this policy may vary depending on the specific terms and conditions provided by King Deo and Queen Grace. It is always advisable for customers to review the company's official policy or contact customer support for accurate and up-to-date information.</p>
